Fracking Data
================================

# California Hydraulic Fracturing Well Data - Version 0.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. We will note when this document is final. 07/12/2013 -- Laci Videmsky

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data gathered here has been downloaded from the State Water Resources Control Board's GeoTracker GAMA (Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment) data portal. [GeoTracker GAMA](http://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/)

Hydraulic Fracking well data is currently not available for download from GeoTracker GAMA. The mapping portal will show data on fracking sites, but does not provide download functionality in the GeoTracker GAMA interface.

The NCWA has scraped the data by exposing urls, and formated the data into CSVs.

Folders & Files
-------------------------

* fracking_wells_poi contains geo refrenced point data
* fracking_wells_pdfs contains PDFs of chemical disclosure reports. Note: GeoTracker GAMA cites [FracFocus](http://www.fracfocusdata.org) as the provider of the chemical disclosure reports.  PDFs provided here are from GeoTracker GAMA service not from FracFocus.


To do
-------------------------

* convert PDFs into a tabular and machine readable format (CSVs).
* document data set
